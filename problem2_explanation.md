# Problem 2: Search in a Rotated Sorted Array

## Method and Data Structures:
Doing bindary search on a rotated sorted array using bindary search allows you to divide the array into 2 halves, one is sorted, other one is sorted but with a pivot where sorted for one part of this side ends and the other part starts.

## Time complexity
Since we are doing a modified binary search for the element, the complexity remains O (log n)

## Space Complexity
Space complexity is O(1) as we are not using more space.
