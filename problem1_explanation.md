# Problem 1: Finding the Square Root of an Integer

## Methods and Data Structures:
The brute force method of searching through 0 to number solves the problem but in time complexity of O (n ** 0.5). Binary search allows an efficient search through the sorted array of 0 to number with lesser time complexity.

## Time Complexity
Binary search to find the nearest square root -> O (log n)

## Space Complexity
O(1), as no extra space is being used
