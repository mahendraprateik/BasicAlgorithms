# Problem 3: Min Max element

## Method and Data Structures:
We do a single traversal and assign the first element as the min and the max. As we loop through, we make comparisons in linear time to update the min and max values.

## Worst case time complexity is: <b> O(n) </b>
Traversing once through the array -> O (n)

## Worst case space complexity is: <b> O(2) </b>
Since we are returning 2 numbers (min and max)
