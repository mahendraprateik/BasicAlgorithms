# Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem

## Method and Data Structures:
We use 3 pointers to track the movement in a single traversal.

## Worst case time complexity is: <b> O(n) </b>
Traversing one time through array to sort it in place -> O (n)

## Worst case space complexity is: <b> O(1) </b>
Since we are doing everything in place
